# Developer Guide

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or later
- npm
- Go 1.21 or later
- Foundry CLI
- A CrowdStrike Falcon API Client with appropriate permissions

## Development Workflow

### Testing UI pages in the console

> [!NOTE]
> Currently when working in **Development mode** you will be interacting with mock data instead of data coming from a collection.

1. In the Falcon console, make sure you enable **Development mode** under developer tools:
    ![preview-mode](../assets/dev-mode.png)

1. Set up the UI development environment:

    ```bash
    cd ui/pages
    npm install
    npm run watch    # Live rebuild on change
    ```

1. In the root directory (in a separate terminal), run:

    ```bash
    foundry apps run
    ```

1. Navigate to **Custom apps** and select **Images** to open the app
<img src="../assets/open-app.png" alt="open-app" width="500">

### Testing functions locally

Foundry functions don't have a "dev mode" so we test locally and then deploy.

Collection writes are enabled when the request includes Foundry function identity
(`fn_id`, exposed by the Go FDK as `Request.FnID`). The local request below omits
that metadata and returns image data without updating the collection, even if an
access token is supplied. Function identity is execution context, not an
authorization check; Falcon API credentials still control collection access.

#### Environment Setup

1. Configure your environment variables:

    ```bash
    export FALCON_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
    export FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
    export FALCON_CLOUD="your-cloud"        # e.g., us-1, eu-1
    export DEBUG=true                       # Optional: Enable debug logging
    ```

2. Start the function server:

    ```bash
    cd functions/syncimages
    go run main.go
    ```

3. Test the function (in a separate terminal):

    ```bash
    curl -X POST --location 'http://localhost:8081' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "body": {},
            "method": "POST",
            "url": "/sync-images"
        }'
    ```

## Previewing the app

To preview the Foundry app after making development changes, please refer to the [Release and Deployment Guide](./RELEASE.md#development-deployments).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **UI Not Updating**:
   1. Ensure Preview mode is enabled
   1. Try clearing browser cache
   1. Verify `npm run watch` is running

1. **Function testing failures**:
   1. Verify environment variables are set correctly
   1. Check API permissions
   1. Enable DEBUG mode for more detailed logs

### Debugging Tips

- Use browser developer tools for UI issues
- Check function logs with `DEBUG=true`
